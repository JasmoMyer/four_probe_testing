# Unit Tests

The tests in this location are Unit tests. This means that they:

* **TEST:** the expected behaviour of a 'unit' of code (e.g. a method)

* **CONTEXT:** are driven from the context of the class / module under test

* **PASS-THROUGH:** a single class / module of the app

* **MOCK:** all dependencies (e.g. any resources that the unit under test depends on)

## How to run

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
