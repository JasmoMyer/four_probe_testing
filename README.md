# Welcome

This repo accompanies the following [post](http://cruft.io/posts/four-probe-testing) on [cruft.io](http://cruft.io).

We'll use it to demo some approaches to testing that have worked well for us. 

We've used Ruby here, but the general approach is transferable to other contexts.

Apologies in advance for all the Aardvarks ...
